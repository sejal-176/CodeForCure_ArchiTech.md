## 📝 Description

ArchiTEch is an intelligent floor-plan generation application that creates Vastu-compliant layouts using minimal inputs such as plot size and house type (1BHK, 2BHK, or 3BHK). It uses Operations Research and constraint-based logic to optimize space and bridge the gap between user needs and practical architectural design.
